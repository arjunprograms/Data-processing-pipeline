# Data-processing-pipeline

Data Processing Pipeline
This repository provides a modular and flexible Data Processing Pipeline for handling structured datasets. It includes a variety of machine learning and data processing techniques such as feature selection, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection, with an emphasis on reusability and customization.

Features
Feature Selection: Extracts important features using methods like Random Forest.
Clustering: Implements K-Means (with Elbow Method optimization) and HDBSCAN for unsupervised learning tasks.
Dimensionality Reduction: Performs PCA and t-SNE for reducing data complexity.
Anomaly Detection: Detects outliers using Local Outlier Factor (LOF).
Visualization: Creates 2D and 3D plots, including labeled data visualization.
Automation: Modular blocks with multiprocessing support for streamlined processing.
Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/arjunprograms/data-processing-pipeline.git
Navigate to the project directory:

cd data-processing-pipeline

Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Directory Structure
inputs/: Place your input datasets here.
outputs/: Contains processed data, visualizations, and other outputs.
bio_pipeline_package/: Includes pipeline components and the base block class.
run.py: Main script for configuring and running the pipeline.
pipeline.log: Log file for tracking pipeline execution steps.
Usage
1. Configure the Pipeline
Open run.py to set up the processing blocks.
Define the input files, parameters, and the sequence of operations for your pipeline.
2. Add Your Data
Place your input files (e.g., CSV datasets) into the inputs/ directory.
3. Run the Pipeline
Execute the main script:

bash
Copy code
python run.py
4. Check Outputs
Processed data and results will be saved in the outputs/ directory.
Log details can be found in pipeline.log.
Example Workflow
Feature Selection: Select top features using Random Forest.
Clustering: Apply K-Means or HDBSCAN to group data.
Dimensionality Reduction: Use PCA or t-SNE for visualization.
Anomaly Detection: Identify and filter out anomalies with LOF.
Visualization: Generate scatter plots or 3D plots for exploratory analysis.
Requirements
Python 3.7 or higher
Libraries: See requirements.txt for the full list.
